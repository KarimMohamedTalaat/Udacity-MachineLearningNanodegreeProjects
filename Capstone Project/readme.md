----------------------------------------------------------

### Install {.code-line data-line-start="3" data-line-end="4"}

This project requires **Python 3.5** or later and the following Python
libraries installed:

-   [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
-   [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
-   [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
-   [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/0.17/install.html)
-   [Keras](https://keras.io/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a
[Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html).

### Code {.code-line data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15"}

A template notebook is provided as `Capstone_Project_HACR.ipynb`.

### Data {.code-line data-line-start="17" data-line-end="18"}

The dataset Arabic Handwritten Characters Dataset from Kaggle you can
find it [here](https://www.kaggle.com/mloey1/ahcd1).

-   The dataset is composed of 16,800 characters written by 60
    participants, the age range is between 19 to 40 years, and 90% of
    participants are right-hand. Each participant wrote each character
    (from ’alef’ to ’yaa’) ten times.
-   The database is partitioned into two sets: a training set (13,440
    characters to 480 images per class) and a test set (3,360 characters
    to 120 images per class).
-   Writers of training set and test set are exclusive.
-   Ordering of including writers to test set are randomized to make
    sure that writers of test set are not from a single institution (to
    ensure variability of the test set).
